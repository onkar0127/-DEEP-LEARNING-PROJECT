## Usage Examples

### Training a New Model

```python
from text_classification import Trainer, TextClassificationModel, TextDataModule

# Initialize data module
data_module = TextDataModule(
    train_file="data/train.csv",
    val_file="data/val.csv",
    text_column="text",
    label_column="label",
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    batch_size=16
)

# Initialize model
model = TextClassificationModel(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    num_classes=4,
    dropout=0.1
)

# Initialize trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    max_epochs=5,
    gpus=1,
    precision=16,  # Mixed precision training
    log_every_n_steps=50
)

# Train model
trainer.fit(model, data_module)
```

### Inference with a Trained Model

```python
from text_classification import TextClassificationModel, TextProcessor

# Load trained model
model = TextClassificationModel.load_from_checkpoint("checkpoints/best-model.ckpt")
model.eval()

# Initialize text processor
processor = TextProcessor(model_name="bert-base-uncased")

# Perform inference
text = "This movie was absolutely fantastic, I enjoyed every minute of it!"
inputs = processor.process_text(text)
prediction = model.predict(inputs)

print(f"Predicted class: {prediction}")
```

## Model Architecture Details

The core architecture consists of:

1. **Transformer Encoder**: Pre-trained BERT/RoBERTa encoder that processes tokenized text
2. **Pooling Layer**: Strategies for sentence representation (CLS token, mean pooling, attention pooling)
3. **Dropout Layer**: Regularization to prevent overfitting
4. **Classification Head**: Fully connected layers with appropriate activation functions

```
Input Text → Tokenization → Transformer Encoder → Pooling → Dropout → Classification Head → Output Probabilities
```

## Training Methodology

The training process incorporates several best practices:

1. **Progressive Learning Rate**: Warm-up followed by linear decay
2. **Gradient Accumulation**: Effective training with larger batch sizes on limited hardware
3. **Mixed Precision**: Using FP16 calculations where appropriate for speed
4. **Regularization**: Weight decay, dropout, and early stopping to prevent overfitting
5. **Data Augmentation**: Applied during training to increase effective dataset size

## Customization Options

The implementation offers extensive customization:

- **Model Selection**: Choose from various pre-trained transformer models
- **Loss Functions**: Support for multiple loss functions (CrossEntropy, Focal Loss, Label Smoothing)
- **Optimization Algorithms**: AdamW, LAMB, Adafactor, and more
- **Learning Rate Schedulers**: Linear, cosine, one-cycle, and custom schedulers

## Future Enhancements

Planned future improvements include:

- Integration with newer transformer architectures (e.g., DeBERTa, LongFormer)
- Knowledge distillation support for model compression
